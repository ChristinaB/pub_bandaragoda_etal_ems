    "In this tutorial you will explore the role of climatology on the spatial development of tree, shrub, and grass Plant Functional Types (PFTs) in a semiarid setting. You will run an ecohydrologic vegetation dynamics model, written using Landlab - a python toolkit for modeling earth surface processes, on a hypothetical flat watershed with varied climatology. The ecohydrologic vegetation dynamics model you will use is based on CATGraSS, a discrete time cellular automata (CA) model for spatial evolution of PFTs [Zhou et al., 2013].  Each cell in the domain can be occupied by a single PFT: Tree, Shrub, Grass or left unoccupied as bare soil. The model couples local ecohydrologic vegetation dynamics, which simulate biomass production based on local soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration, with spatial processes for plant establishment and mortality controlled by seed dispersal rules, water stress tolerance, and space availability (Figure 1). Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress of each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress.\n",

    "The model is driven by rainfall pulses (observed or generated), solar radiation and temperature. The latter two variables can also be used to prescribe a seasonal potential evapotranspiration input. In Landlab, the model is implemented as a set of interacting components, each describing a different element of the coupled system: PrecipitationDistribution, Radiation, PotentialEvapotranspiration, SoilMoisture, Vegetation (component for local vegetation growth), and VegCA (component for cellular automaton establishment and mortality of PFTs, i.e. spatial dynamics of vegetation pattern evolution). Each process can also operate in isolation, outside the context of this example model. Landlab components and the flow chart used to couple the components in the model driver is given below [Hobley et al., 2017]. \n",

We then bin the data into three elevation ranges and within each bin daily precipitation (mm), minimum and maximum temperature (<sup>o</sup>C) data are spatially averaged for every day. This led to time series of daily precipitation (mm), minimum and maximum temperature in each elevation band. To keep this notebook concise (and to focus on data processing and ecohydrology model implementation), we placed the code used for this hydrometeorological data processing in a separate notebook called: 'observatory_gridmet_newmexico.ipynb', available in the sub-folder ogh_newmexico.

    " - In the low elevation band, the climate is arid (Aridity Index (AI) = 7.34) [Middleton et al. (1997)]. Drought-tolerant shrubs outcompete trees, leaving few trees. Grass gradually retreats resulting in a shrub dominant ecosystem with grass becoming the secondary PFT.\n",
    " - In the mid elevation band, the climate is cooler and wetter than low elevation band (AI = 5) with aridity in the transition zone from arid to semi-arid climate [Middleton et al. (1997)]. It is interesting to note that all three PFTs co-exist in this climate with trees dominating, grass as secondary PFT and shrubs as tertiary PFT.\n",
    " - In the high elevation band, the climate is the coolest and wettest among all elevation bands. The climate is seim-arid (AI = 3.66) [Middleton et al. (1997)]. Trees dominate the relatively moisture abundant ecosystem. Grass gradually retreats with few shrubs left behind.\n",

    " - You can re-run the simulations for longer periods to see if the trajectories we obtained above are stable. You can do this by increasing ***n***. You can check if the ecosystem responses observed in this example still hold when the model is run for longer periods of time.\n",
    " - You can re-run the model with a different set of input parameters. You can edit ***ecohyd_inputs.yaml*** and re-run the model by changing the input parameters (e.g., soil properties, PFT properties, etc..)"
